01 The larger the metrices including SSIM, STD, EI, SF, AG, MI,
GMS, VIF, and TMQI, the better the quality of the fused image
is. The smaller the metric SSEQ is, the better the quality of
the fused image is. 

02 THE METRICES FROM ONE TO TEN FROM Anatomical-Functional Image Fusion by
Information of Interest in Local Laplacian Filtering Domain

THE METRICES FROM ELEVEN TO FIFTEEN FROM Medical Image Fusion With Parameter-Adaptive Pulse 
Coupled Neural Network in Nonsubsampled Shearlet Transform Domain

For all the above Ô¨Åve metrics, a larger score indicates a better performance.
