This package contains the code which is associated with the following paper:
Yu Liu and Zengfu Wang, "A Practical Pan-Sharpening Method with Wavelet Transform and Sparse Representation ", proceedings of the 10th IEEE International Conference on Imaging Systems and Techniques, Oct. 2013, pp. 288-293.

Usage of this code is free for research purposes only. 

Please refer to the above publication if you use this code. Thank you.

Please note that there is a little difference between the implementary details here and the decriptions in the above paper, so the objective scores reported in the paper may be not very accurate (another reason is that some evaluation codes contained mistakes when we used them). Please take this code as the standard implementation of the method proposed in the above paper.
