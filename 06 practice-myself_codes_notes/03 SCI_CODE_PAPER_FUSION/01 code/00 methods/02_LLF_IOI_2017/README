% These scripts implement edge-aware detail and tone manipulation as 
% described in Paris, Hasinoff, and Kautz, "Local Laplacian Filters:
% Edge-aware Image Processing with a Laplacian Pyramid", ACM 
% Transactions on Graphics (Proc. SIGGRAPH 2011), 30(4), 2011.

% The key scripts for the proposed fusion method:
&&   the_proposed_fusion_method.m      - the main function of the proposed method  
&&   lapfilter_core.m                  - the core algorithm of the propsoed fusion method           
&&   fusionrule_lowpass.m              - information of interest based image fusion rule for approximate image(lowpass image) decomposed by local Laplacian filter
&&   fusionrule_highpass.m             - information of interest based image fusion rule for residual image(highpass image) decomposed by local Laplacian filter

% Includes Laplacian pyramid routines adapted from Tom Mertens'
% Matlab implementation.

&& The key scripts for the objective metrics evaluation for the fused images:
&&   objective_metric_evaluation.m     - the main function of the objective metrics for the fused images 
&&   evaluation1.m                     - the core algorithm of the objective metrics for the fused images
&&   space_frequency.m                 - the space frequency (SF) function
&&   edge_intensity.m                  - the edge intensity (EI) function
&&   mutinf.m                          - the mutual information (MI) function
&&   TMQI.m                            - the  tone-mapped image quality index  tone-mapped image quality index (TMQI) function
