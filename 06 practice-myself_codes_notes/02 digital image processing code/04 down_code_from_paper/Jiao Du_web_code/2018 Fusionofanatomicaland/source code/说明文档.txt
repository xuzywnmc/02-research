Note: add the files named CSF and ESF to the current path
Then, run the files with the order: test1.m, run_saliency.m, test2.m and test3.m

test 1: image decomposition
run_saliency.m: to get the CSF feature of the input image in pseudo-color
test 2: the salience features of the decomposed images: CSF and ESF
test 3: image reconstruction
